#Files dropbox

##What is it?

It is a simple php script which when dropped into a server directory turns that directory into a file dropbox which you can log into and upload files to share.
  
##What is the point of it?

It allows you to share files, rename files, delete files and transfer files to the dropbox from other websites. I made it after needing a quick solution to share files in an environment where all file sharing websites are blocked.
  
##Installation

Installation is really simple, just copy the files onto a webserver running php and change the username and password at the top of the index.php file. Default username is 'root' and password is 'password'.
